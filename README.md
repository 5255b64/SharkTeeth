## Intro
 - Inspired by the classic "Crocodile Dentist" toy, "Shark Teeth" brings a unique and exciting twist to the world of GameFi. In this game, each shark has one bad tooth among a mouthful of healthy teeth. Players can place their bets and choose to touch a tooth. If the chosen tooth is healthy, the player wins rewards. However, if the unlucky player touches the bad tooth, they lose their bet and the game ends.
 - The in-game currency is called Shark Gold, which is used for placing bets and receiving rewards. Each time a player places a bet, it is referred to as a fee, and the rewards they receive are called bonuses. Additionally, every time a player performs a touch operation, the fee for the next player to touch will increase.
 - "Shark Teeth" combines the thrill of chance with strategic betting, offering an engaging and rewarding experience for all players.
